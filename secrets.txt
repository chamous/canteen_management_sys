The app.secret_key attribute in Flask is used to secure our application's client-side sessions and protect them from tampering. When we set a secret key, Flask will use it to cryptographically sign the session cookies sent to the client.

This helps to ensure that the session data stored on the client-side is not modified by attackers, as any changes to the data will invalidate the signature. It also prevents attackers from creating their own session cookies, as they won't know the secret key needed to sign them.

Without a secret key, Flask will not be able to sign the session cookies, making them vulnerable to tampering and leaving our application open to security risks.

Therefore, it's important to set a strong and random secret key for our Flask app using a library like secrets to ensure the security of our client-side sessions.
